# MultiClass Text classification
This repository is dedicated to multiclass (more than 2) text classification by applying different methods:
	
	- Supervised learning: using Naive bayes, Logistic regression, Support vector machine and K Nearest Neighbors.
	- Deep Learning models: using basic LSTM (for now, updates are coming soon)
